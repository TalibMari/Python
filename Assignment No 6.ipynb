    "#    Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. \n",
    "#    Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc \n",
    "#    in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them \n",
    "#    so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function."

    "#   Here’s a detailed look at some of OOP’s top benefits:\n",
    "#      1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting:\n",
    "#             When working with object-oriented programming languages, you know exactly where to look.“Oh, \n",
    "#             the car object broke down?The problem must be in the Car class!” You don’t have to muck through anything else.\n",
    "#      2. Reuse of code through inheritance:\n",
    "#             Everyone builds their objects separately but discover commonalities between them. In fact, \n",
    "#             each object is really just a different kind of Car. This is where the inheritance technique\n",
    "#             saves time: Create one generic class (Car), and then define the subclasses (RaceCar and Limousine) \n",
    "#             that are to inherit the generic class’s traits.\n",
    "#      3. Flexibility through polymorphism:\n",
    "#             Riffing on this example, you now need just a few drivers, or functions, like “driveCar,” driveRaceCar” \n",
    "#             and “DriveLimousine.” RaceCarDrivers share some traits with LimousineDrivers, but other things, \n",
    "#             like RaceHelmets and BeverageSponsorships, are unique.\n",
    "#      4. Effective problem solving:\n",
    "#             Object-oriented programming is often the most natural and pragmatic approach, once you get the hang of it. \n",
    "#             OOP languages allows you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve \n",
